# A Todo app with "no" dependencies

## That being said, the dependencies are

- A _new_ Node version, because this is using [experimental modules](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html)
- A decent browser

# Test modifying the readme editee
## Rules

- Focus on learning
- No additional dependencies. A custom solution for everything. How hard can it be?
- Keep the domain super simple, unless X-requirement opens up an interesting problem you would like to learn about
- Don't prematurely overengineer, unless, of course, you want to learn

## Requirements

- Todos should not be lost easily
- Fast
- UI is also very fast
  - Optimistic updates (everywhere?)

## Running

```
bin/node server
```

## Testing

```
bin/node test
```
